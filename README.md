3-1:Creates a dataset X with values from 0 to 999 and assigns labels Y as 1 for values between 500 and 800 and 0 otherwise.
Trains both a Logistic Regression and an SVM model with rbf kernel on this dataset.
Predicts the output with both models and plots their predictions and decision boundaries in a two-panel plot using matplotlib, with markers and colors to distinguish between true labels and predictions.

Defines a Gaussian function and generates 1000 random points for two variables (x1, x2) to simulate 3D Gaussian-distributed data.
Allows users to adjust a threshold using a Streamlit slider to classify points based on their distance from the origin.
Trains a linear SVM model on this data and visualizes classification results in 3D and 2D with clear boundary indicators and separation planes.

## prompt

3-3
Defines an elliptical distribution function and generates non-circularly distributed data points.
Allows users to adjust a threshold using a Streamlit slider to classify points based on elliptical distances.
Trains a linear SVM on the generated data and visualizes classification boundaries and separation planes in both 3D and 2D plots.
